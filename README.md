# greenfield-relayer

The Greenfield Relayer is a tool that allows bidirectional communication between Greenfield and BSC. It operates separately 
and can only be utilized by Greenfield validators. This relayer continuously monitors cross-chain events on BSC and 
Greenfield, storing them in a database. After a few blocks have been confirmed and reached finality, the relayer uses a BLS 
private key to sign a message confirming the event. This signed event, also known as "the vote", is then broadcasted through 
Greenfield's p2p network. Once enough votes are collected from Greenfield relayers, the relay assembles a cross-chain package 
transaction and submits it to either the BSC or Greenfield network.

## Disclaimer
**The software and related documentation are under active development, all subject to potential future change without
notification and not ready for production use. The code and security audit have not been fully completed and not ready
for any bug bounty. We advise you to be careful and experiment on the network at your own risk. Stay safe out there.**

## Main Components
The relayer mainly consists of 3 components: Listener, Vote Processor and Transaction Assembler.

1. The Listener component actively monitors blockchains for any cross-chain events and stores them in the database.

2. The Vote Processor component performs the following functions:
   a. retrieves unprocessed cross-chain events from database, signs and broadcasts votes for them to the Greenfield P2P network.
   b. collects enough valid votes for cross-chain events from the Greenfield P2P network and saves them to the database.

3. The Transaction Assembler component prepares and submits transactions to the destination chain by aggregating the 
   votes and signatures of cross-chain events that have received enough consensus votes. 


### Requirement

Go version above 1.20

## Deployment

    "start_height": 0,
    "chain_id": 714
  }
```

2. Config crosschain and greenfield light client smart contracts addresses, others can keep default value. 
```
"relay_config": {
    "bsc_to_greenfield_inturn_relayer_timeout": 40,
    "greenfield_to_bsc_inturn_relayer_timeout": 30,
    "greenfield_sequence_update_latency": 8,
    "bsc_sequence_update_latency": 12,
    "cross_chain_contract_addr": "0xd2253A26e6d5b729dDBf4bCce5A78F93C725b455",
    "greenfield_light_client_contract_addr": "0x349a42f907c7562B3aaD4431780E4596bC2a053f"
  }
```
3. Set your log and backup preferences.
```
"log_config": {
  "level": "DEBUG",
  "filename": "log.txt",
  "max_file_size_in_mb": 100 (file size threshold)  
  "max_backups_of_log_files": 2 (backup count threshold)
  "max_age_to_retain_log_files_in_days": 10 (backup age threshold)
  "use_console_logger": true,
  "use_file_logger": false,
  "compress": false
}
```
4. Config your database settings. We Support mysql or sqlite.

example: use mysql
```
"db_config": {
  "dialect": "mysql",
    "key_type": "local_private_key",
    "aws_region": "",
    "aws_secret_name": "",
    "password": "pass",
    "username": "root",
    "url": "/greenfield-relayer?charset=utf8&parseTime=True&loc=Local",
    "max_idle_conns": 10,
    "max_open_conns": 100
}
```

 use sqlite
```
  "db_config": {
    "dialect": "sqlite3",
    "key_type": "",
    "aws_region": "",
    "aws_secret_name": "",
    "password": "",
    "username": "",
    "url": "greenfield-relayer.db",
    "max_idle_conns": 10,
    "max_open_conns": 100
  },


```

5. Set alert config to send a telegram message when the data-seeds are not healthy.
```
"alert_config": {
  "identity": your_bot_identity
  "telegram_bot_id": your_bot_id
  "telegram_chat_id": your_chat_id  
}
```

## Build

Build binary:

```shell script
$ make build
```

Build docker image:

```shell script
$ make build_docker
```


## Run locally

### Run MySQL in Docker(this can be skipped if you are using sqlite)

```shell
docker run --name gnfd-mysql -p 3306:3306 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root -d mysql:8.0
```

#### Create Schema

Create schema in MySQL client:

```mysql
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS `greenfield-relayer` DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci;
```

### Fill in config file

Get relayer private key and bls private key in Hex format, fill them in the config/config.json alone with Greenfield, 
BSC network RPC addresses, chain id and BSC smart contracts addresses.

```shell script
$ ./build/greenfield-relayer --config-type [local or aws] --config-path config_file_path  --aws-region [aws region or omit] --aws-secret-key [aws secret key for config or omit]
```

Example:
```shell script
$ ./build/greenfield-relayer --config-type local --config-path config/config.json
```

Run docker:
```shell script
$ docker run -it -v /your/data/path:/greenfield-relayer -e CONFIG_TYPE="local" -e CONFIG_FILE_PATH=/your/config/file/path/in/container -d greenfield-relayer
```

### Quick setup for running multiple relayers in local 
Fill in config files under `./config/local` by following above instruction, you might want to fill in same number of greenfield validators you bootstrap in local,
```bash
// start n instance of relayer 
bash ./deployment/localup/localup.sh start ${SIZE}

// stop relayer
bash ./deployment/localup/localup.sh stop
```
